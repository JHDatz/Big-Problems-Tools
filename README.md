# Big-Problems-Tools

This repository contains all prior functions, tutorials, etc that were deemed useful enough to keep in a central repository for future big problems students to take advantage of. The "All Groups" folder from the primary Big Problems repository contains all files worked on from that given year, while this repository is the complete package of all material. The folders are organized as follows:

**Code-Alongs**: A demonstration of how the MySQL server or R programming can be used to recreate the results of various Sabermetrics texts.

**Presentations**: A folder of all given presentations this year by myself or my teams.

**Python Scripts and Tutorials**: A folder composed of all python scripts, or tutorials written into scripts, that applied to both groups.

**R Scripts and Tutorials**: Same as above, but for R scripts instead.

**SQL Database Generator**: Taken a bit further than in 2020, I have created a MySQL server on Amazon AWS for students to access and work with various Sabermetrics
databases. The code in this folder is a collection of R scripts which populate a MySQL server from scratch.

**Sample Data**: For first-time programmers who are struggling a bit, there are a few CSV files in this folder for them to work with to generate some ideas.

**Stored Procedures, Views, Queries, and Funtions**: A folder of all MySQL scripts prepared this semester. In future classes these scripts will become part of the
SQL Database Generator and be auto-populated into a new MySQL Server.

**To Be Cleaned Up**: A set of files that need to be worked on a bit before being moved elsewhere.
